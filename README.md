# Learning TensorFlow - Journey to EDISS 2028

My personal learning repository documenting my 2-year journey building skills in TensorFlow, Deep Learning, and Data-Intensive Systems.

## Goal
Prepare for **EDISS (Erasmus Mundus in Data-Intensive and Intelligent Software Systems)** application in 2028.

## Progress Tracker

### Week 1 - Foundations

**Day 1** (January 25, 2025)
- ✅ NumPy fundamentals
- ✅ Array operations, slicing, indexing
- ✅ Boolean indexing and broadcasting
- ✅ Reshape operations
- File: `day1_numpy_fundamentals.ipynb`

**Day 2** (January 26, 2025)
- ✅ TensorFlow tensor fundamentals
- ✅ Tensor operations and computational graphs
- ✅ Built first neural network (Keras Sequential API)
- ✅ Trained MNIST digit classifier
- **Result: 90% test accuracy**
- Files: `day2_tensorflow_fundamentals.ipynb`, `day2_mnist_classifier.ipynb`

**Day 3** (January 27, 2025)
- 🏥 Rest day - health first
- 📝 Organized repository and documentation
